<h1>Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>3 of the biggest risks with communication in online gaming would be, cyberbullying, cybersecurity, and anonymity. Another risk posed by communication in online gaming is child exposure to toxic environments.<br><br>Cyberbullying indicates an aggressive , premeditated act often carried out by a group or individual through the use of electronic contact. Cyberbullying can be done with the use of voice or text chat in game. An example of cyberbullying through voice chat would be verbally insulting a person. Individuals that have been cyberbullied often have low self-esteem, increased anxiety and are more vulnerable to depression, these problems caused by cyberbullying often lead to it affecting them in real life as well.<br><br>Cyber security in online gaming is extremely important. Since online gaming is increasing, hackers have now gained an opportunity to easily manipulate users online. Through the use of text chat and voice communication in video games, hackers will often try and entice you to visit fake websites or open email attachments that contain malicious software. Identity theft is also another risk that falls under cyber security. If your profile in online games contains personal information i.e your first name and last name, malicious individuals are able to steal your name and create fake accounts using your name. According to Hayes (2008), In South Korea, more than 1000 individuals had their identities stolen and compromised through a game called “Lineage”, they then had fake accounts under their name without their knowledge.<br><br>Anonymity is the state of being anonymous. Anonymity in online gaming is related to cyberbullying. This is because individuals are able to freely harass someone while their identity is completely anonymous, this gives them a sense of protection. Anonymity also allows an individual to create an online persona. These online personas can cause problems while gaming online as they can be used to harass or lure younger individuals to online predators.<br><br>Child exposure to online gaming is also another risk. This is because younger people are usually victims of cyberbullying. They are often victims of cyberbullying because many people online see children as easy targets. Also because they don’t fully understand how toxic some of the gaming communities can be. Many people take advantage of young children when gaming online, an example of this can be communicating with them through text chat and asking them to give their parents credit card information in return for something, otherwise known as scamming.<br><br> <p></h4>
