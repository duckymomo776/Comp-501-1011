</ul><h4><p>Education on cyberbullying<br>
Hong and Espelage (2017) suggests that while there is not any consensus to identify and prevent cyberbullying, there are steps everyone can take to give awareness and help prevent cyberbullying. They suggest that information is pivotal to help with the efforts. Everyone should check the websites and tip sheets that give them awareness of the consequences of cyberbullying. They also suggest that parents are key to preventing any form of cyberbullying. Parents of children need to respond instantly if any sort of cyberbullying occurs, this helps prevent more negative impacts such as potential suicide and mental breakdowns. Another aspect this research suggests is that people need to be more open to their medical helper. People tend to be scared or unwilling to open up about their cyberbullying experience and this cascades to negative choices that may harm them or others around them. <br><br>
2-Factor authentication<br>
Two-factor authentication is a system that requires a user to verify two levels of security, to authenticate a user to protect the security of the user. Game companies allow a user to bind their mobile phone to their account. This is done by inputting your mobile phone number or different email to your game account then, a dynamically generated passcode is sent to the user via text message, or email. Setting up two-factor authentication to your account makes it difficult for a malicious individual to get access to your account as simply obtaining your password will not grant them access to your account. This significantly decreases the chances of getting sensitive information leaked out and further secures your account. <br><br>
Gandolfi and Antonacci (2020) suggests that violence in video games may not be all bad. This may seem controversial when it comes to children which of course it is but an example given in this article shows how there can be a good way for it to be used. For example, there is a bit in this article which mainly focuses on the game overwatch (a first-person shooter developed by blizzard) where a team member sacrificed themselves for the team. This can help show altruistic characteristics and encourage teamwork and good communication with team mates. There is also the point though where people can be negative or even actively trying to ruin the game for people if they donâ€™t feel like they are winning. This could lead to younger players being bullied for being bad at the game or new and this behaviour could be picked up by them and be continued to be spread because they think that is how they are supposed to talk in game. This can be prevented by having a good team of people who watch over what is being said in pre-game lobbies and the post-game lobbies. Another solution can be a report button to report people who are being overly abusive or disruptive or just a mute button so that other people can just turn them off. Game developers could also code in a prompt that asks a player to input their age or date of birth that could restrict some content or group people into multiplayer to be matched with people close to their age. This feature could also be done with parental controls and will either change and be updated when the system goes past their day of birth (thus making them older) or when parental controls are removed.
