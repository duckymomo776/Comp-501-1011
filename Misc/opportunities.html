<h1>Opportunities</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Different types of communication are present in games for improved experiences.
“The ability to communicate during online gaming is one that has become fundamental. Players could use voice, textual chat, predetermined commands or ....”(Spyridonis et al, 2018)
One aspect is the multiple layers of communication as studied by this article. Spyridonis and his colleagues suggest that players use different types of communication depending on the environment they are in. It is discussed that people who are not well known to each other tend to rely on textual chat, while people who are more familiar with one another tend to use voice chat. Voice chatting increases the decision making between individuals as they are solving an issue in real time, while textual chat can take time to type out, slowing down productivity in gaming.<br><br>Communication in online gaming also improves controllability amongst younger people. Adolescent individuals are usually really timid and scared of interacting with people they have never met before. The communication aspect of online games gives the young people a sense of security through the anonymity aspect it offers. The individual will feel more safe when they do not need to worry about their insecurities and the pressure to face someone directly. This can be very advantageous because it breaks the barrier of fear and uncertainty by adding a safety net around the person and this causes the task at hand to be completed more easily as well as introduces peer to peer communication digitally.(Patti and Jochen, 2010).<br><br>Another opportunity present in communication in online gaming results in improved cognitive abilities. Barr (2017) suggests that people who play video games alongside their university studies have a more likelihood of improving their communication, listening skills andreal-life skills as opposed to students who do not game at all. The study took place in the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He recruited 16 university students to play different video games over a period of 8 weeks averaging to about 14 hours. He also had a control group of students that did not play any video games. A questionnaire was given to the students before and after the study to determine if there were any improvements between the two groups. The study concludes that the students who gamed had a higher percentage of scoring higher marks than the control group that did not play any video games. This showcases that communication in online gaming can improve learning in an educational setting.<br><br><p></h4>
