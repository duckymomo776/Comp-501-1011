<h1>Communication in online gaming</h1>


</ul><h5><p>This website has been designed to cover the topic of communication in online gaming. It will show why this topic is and will become more prevalent in todayâ€™s society and why people should consider the impact that it has on society.<br><br>
First a brief definition of both what online gaming is and what communication is. Online gaming can be defined as an electronic game that can be played over a network, usually the internet (Ray, 2018). Communication can be defined as a way to convey information in the form of shapes, signs, symbols or behaviour (Merriam-Webster, 2021). It may not seem clear as to how combining these two things as our topic might be relevant to today's society but as a study by newzoo shows the amount of people who play online games is increasing and soon maybe everyone will be playing at least one online game. This would mean that most people would be affected by the interactions with others through playing a game. This would have some benefits Like educational use in the form of maths games for young children or people who struggle to learn from textbooks. It may also take the form of a sort of social event where a person and their friends could hang out online, for example if a lockdown happened. There will also be risk too just like with everything in like for example cyber bullying of other people for any variety or reason like something as simple as them being new to the game. There is also always the risk of cybersecurity in the sense that if the game has microtransactions to buy in-game items, that would require sensitive information that companies or hackers who hacked into the game's data centres could abuse. It's not all bad though since we will explore some ways these things can be medicated or even prevented.<p></h5>
